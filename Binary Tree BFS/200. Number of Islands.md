# 200. Number of Islands
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 
## Example
**Example 1**  
Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]  
]   
Output: 1  

**Example 2**  
Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]  
]  
Output: 3  

## 想法
先找到"1"後再用bfs找相連的1

## Code
**Python**
```ruby
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        director = [[1,0], [0,1], [-1,0], [0,-1]]
        count = 0
        for i in range(0,len(grid)):
            for j in range(0,len(grid[0])):
                if(grid[i][j]=="1" ):
                    queue = list()
                    queue.append([i,j])
                    count +=1
                    grid[i][j] = "0"
                    while(len(queue)!=0):
                        cur = queue.pop(0)        
                        for d in director:
                            a = cur[0] + d[0]
                            b = cur[1] + d[1]
                            if(0<=a<len(grid) and 0<=b<len(grid[0]) and grid[a][b] == "1" ):
                                queue.append([a, b])
                                grid[a][b] = "0"
        return count
```
