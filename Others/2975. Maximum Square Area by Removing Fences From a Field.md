# 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field
There is a large `(m - 1) x (n - 1)` rectangular field with corners at (1, 1) and (m, n) containing some `horizontal` and `vertical` fences given in arrays hFences and vFences respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates (hFences[i], 1) to (hFences[i], n) and vertical fences are from the coordinates (1, vFences[i]) to (m, vFences[i]).

Return the maximum area of `a square field` that can be formed by removing some fences (possibly none) or `-1` if it is impossible to make a square field.

Since the answer may be large, return it `modulo 109 + 7`.

Note: The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates `(1, 1) to (1, n)` and `(m, 1) to (m, n)` and two vertical fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (m, 1) and (1, n) to (m, n). These fences cannot be removed.

 
## Example
**Example 1**

Input: m = 4, n = 3, hFences = [2,3], vFences = [2]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Removing the horizontal fence at 2 and the vertical fence at 2 will give a square field of area 4.  

**Example 2**  

Input: m = 6, n = 7, hFences = [2], vFences = [4]  
Output: -1  
Explanation: It can be proved that there is no way to create a square field by removing fences.  

## 想法
找最大正方形面積  
所以h = [1, hFences, m], v = [1, vFences, n]  
算出所有間隔的距離  
若其中h中的間隔 == v中的間隔，則return square, 否則 return -1  

## Code
```ruby
class Solution:
    def maximizeSquareArea(self, m: int, n: int, hFences: List[int], vFences: List[int]) -> int:
        h = [1] + hFences + [m]
        v = [1] + vFences + [n]
        sorted_h = sorted([abs(x-y) for x, y in combinations(h, 2)], reverse = True)
        set_v = set(abs(x-y) for x, y in combinations(v, 2))

        for i in sorted_h:
            if i in set_v:
                return (i**2) % (10**9+7)
        return -1
```
