# 133. Clone Graph
Given a reference of a node in a `connected` undirected graph.

Return a `deep copy` (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 
## Example
**Example 1**  

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]  
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]  
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.  
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  

**Example 2**  

Input: adjList = [[]]  
Output: [[]]  
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.  

**Example 3**  
Input: adjList = []  
Output: []  
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.  

## 想法
我適用BFS搜尋法(資料結溝為queue裝搜尋到的點)，用dict裝新的圖  
先將node加入queue中，然後取出queue中的node去搜尋neighbors，把找到的neighbor建立在graph後再把neighbor裝進queue中
