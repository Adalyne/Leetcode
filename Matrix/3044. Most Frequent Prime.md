# 3044. Most Frequent Prime
You are given a `m x n` 0-indexed 2D matrix `mat`. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:  
- There could be at most 8 paths from the cells namely: `east`, `south-east`, `south`, `south-west`, `west`, `north-west`, `north`, and `north-east`.  
- Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.  
- Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are 1, 9, 1, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: 1, 19, 191.  
Return the most frequent `prime number` greater than `10` out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or -1 if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.  

**Note**: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.  

## Example
**Example 1**  
Input: mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]  
Output: 19  
Explanation:   
From cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:  
East: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].  
The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.  

**Example 2**  
Input: mat = [[7]]  
Output: -1  
Explanation: The only number which can be formed is 7. It is a prime number however it is not greater than 10, so return -1.  

**Example 3**  
Input: mat = [[9,7,8],[4,6,5],[2,8,6]]  
Output: 97  
Explanation:  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,0) in all possible directions are: [97,978,96,966,94,942].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [78,75,76,768,74,79].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,2) in all possible directions are: [85,856,86,862,87,879].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [46,465,48,42,49,47].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [65,66,68,62,64,69,67,68].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,2) in all possible directions are: [56,58,56,564,57,58].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [28,286,24,249,26,268].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [86,82,84,86,867,85].  
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,2) in all possible directions are: [68,682,66,669,65,658].  
The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 97.  

## 想法
將每個方向都寫一個def，回傳每個方向的數字  
再來將這些數字做統計，再找出freq最高的數字且為質數
