# 198. House Robber
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and `it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night`.  

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.  

 
## Example
**Example 1**  
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.  

**Example 2**  
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]  
Output: 12  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).  
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.  

## 想法
用DP的概念，一開始一定先想要先偷第一間還是第二間?  
所以想法長這樣[rob1, rob2, n, n+1, n+2, n+3, ...]  
假如偷第一間rob1，再來只能偷第三間n  
所以再來思考的是偷rob1+n 還是 rob2比較好  
(rob2一直都是存最好的結果)  

## Code
**Python**
```ruby
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        rob1, rob2 = 0, 0

        #[rob1, rob2, n, n+1, ...]
        for n in nums:
            temp = max(rob1+n, rob2)
            rob1 = rob2
            rob2 = temp

        return rob2
```
**C++**
```ruby
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int rob1 = 0, rob2 = 0;

        for(int n: nums){
            int temp = max(rob1+n, rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = temp;
        }
        return rob2;
    }
};
```
**Java**
```ruby
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int rob1 = 0, rob2 = 0;

        for(int n: nums){
            int temp = Math.max(rob1+n, rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = temp;
        }
        return rob2;
    }
}
```
