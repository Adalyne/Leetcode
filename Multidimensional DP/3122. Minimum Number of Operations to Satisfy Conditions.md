# 3122. Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions
You are given a 2D matrix grid of size `m x n`. In one operation, you can change the value of any cell to any non-negative number. You need to perform some operations such that each cell grid[i][j] is:

Equal to the cell below it, i.e. `grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j]` (if it exists).
Different from the cell to its right, i.e. `grid[i][j] != grid[i][j + 1]` (if it exists).
Return the minimum number of operations needed.

 
## Example
**Example 1**  
Input: grid = [[1,0,2],[1,0,2]]  
Output: 0  

Explanation:  



All the cells in the matrix already satisfy the properties.  

**Example 2**  
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]  
Output: 3  

Explanation:  



The matrix becomes [[1,0,1],[1,0,1]] which satisfies the properties, by doing these 3 operations:  

Change grid[1][0] to 1.  
Change grid[0][1] to 0.  
Change grid[1][2] to 1.  

**Example 3**  
Input: grid = [[1],[2],[3]]  
Output: 2  

Explanation:  

There is a single column. We can change the value to 1 in each cell using 2 operations.  

## Code
**Python**
```ruby
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        count = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                count[j][grid[i][j]] += 1
        
        @cache
        def dp(j, prv_value):
            if j == -1:
                return 0
            
            ans = inf
            for val in range(10):
                if val != prv_value:
                    ans = min(ans, m - count[j][val] + dp(j - 1, val))
            return ans
        
        return dp(n - 1, -1)
```
