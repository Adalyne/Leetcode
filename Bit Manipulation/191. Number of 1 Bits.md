# 191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).  

**Note**  
Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.  
 
# Example  
**Example 1**  
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.  

**Example 2**   
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.  

**Example 3**  
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101  
Output: 31  
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.  

# 想法
將(n and 1)可以得到個位數是否為1  
再將n往右移1個bit  
(這方法非常快，不用超過5ms即可把所有測資跑完)  
# Code
**C++**
```ruby
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while(n>0){
            cnt += n&1;
            n>>=1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
**Python**  
```ruby
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n)[2:].count('1')
```
**Java**  
```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            cnt+= n & 1;
            n>>=1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
